    <h2>What is Facial Recognition Technology & Why we chose it.</h2>

    <p>We decided to focus on Facial Recognition Technology (FRT), the tech that uses artificial 
intelligence to identify or verify people based on their face. You’ve probably used it 
without thinking about it, unlocking your phone, tagging someone on Instagram, or 
breezing through airport security.</p> 
      
<p>But there’s a darker side. While this tech makes life easier in a lot of ways, it also raises 
huge questions about privacy, fairness, and control. We chose it because it’s one of the 
best examples of a technology that’s both cool and controversial. It solves problems and 
creates them, all at once.</p> 
      
<p>Facial Recognitoin Technology is powerful. It can find missing people or speed up lines at customs. But it can also 
get people wrongly arrested or let the government watch your every move. That tension 
is exactly why we wanted to talk about it.</p>

    <h2>What Is Facial Recognition & Why We Picked It</h2>
    <div class="banner">

    </div>
    <p>Facial recognition is basically when computers recognize you just by your face! It uses artificial intelligence to scan things like the distance between your eyes, your nose shape, jawline, and compares that to other images. You’ve probably used it to unlock your iPhone or seen it auto-tagging people on Instagram photos. It feels pretty normal now, but it’s actually a big deal! We picked it because it's one of those technologies that sounds super convenient, but once you dig deeper, it gets kind of disturbing. It’s not just about phones. It’s being used by cops, airports, stores, and even governments. That’s why we thought it deserved a closer look!</p>

  <section id="realworld" style="display:none">
    <h2>Real-World Uses (And Why They’re Not Always Great)</h2>
    <div class="banner">
      <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/06/18/14/18/camera-813747_1280.jpg" alt="Surveillance camera in use">
    </div>
    <p>Facial recognition is already out there in a lot of places. More than most people realize! Police departments, for example, use it to match suspects from security footage to mugshots or driver’s licenses. Sounds helpful, right? But it’s made some big mistakes. Robert Williams, a Black man in Detroit, was arrested just because the system thought he looked like someone else. That’s seriously messed up.</p>
    <p>Then there's Clearview AI, a company that scraped billions of public photos from Instagram, Facebook, and even LinkedIn without asking anyone! They basically built a huge facial database and sold it to police. It’s legal in the U.S., but super creepy when you think about how your face could be part of that database and you’d never know.</p>
    <p>Rite Aid also used facial recognition in stores to stop shoplifting. But it was later found they were using it mostly in neighborhoods with non-white communities. That’s not just unfair, it’s discriminatory. Even at airports, it’s used to speed up lines, but travelers don’t really get a say. So yeah, it’s useful in some ways, but it also raises a ton of concerns!</p>

    <h2>Why It’s a Big Deal + Risks</h2>
    <div class="banner">
      <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2245195/pexels-photo-2245195.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" alt="Privacy and surveillance art">
    </div>
    <p>This tech isn’t just cool. It actually has some major risks! First off, it’s biased. Studies show it makes way more mistakes with people who have darker skin, especially Black women. That’s not just a small problem. It’s dangerous. People have been arrested, denied services, and judged just because the system got it wrong.</p>
    <p>Then there’s the privacy problem. Most people have no idea they’re even being scanned! You walk into a store, pass a camera, and boom. Your face might be saved forever in some database. You didn’t agree to that, and there’s no easy way to opt out. That’s not okay.</p>
    <p>And finally, surveillance is becoming way too common. In places like China, facial recognition is used to track people every second. What they do, where they go, even who they hang out with. It’s like being watched all the time. And if we don’t set rules, the same thing could happen here.</p>

    <h2>Is It Worth It? + Points of View</h2>
    <div class="banner">
      <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7320419/pexels-photo-7320419.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" alt="Protest or ethical debate">
    </div>
    <p>So here’s the big question. Is facial recognition worth it? Some people say yes, because it helps catch criminals and makes things faster. Law enforcement really likes it and says it’s just another tool in their toolbox.</p>
    <p>But a lot of people say no. Civil rights groups believe it’s being used to spy on people, especially during protests or in public places. They think it’s unfair and dangerous, and want it banned or at least controlled way better.</p>
    <p>Ethicists are kind of in the middle. They say we don’t need to throw it away, but we should definitely build in some protections. Like only using it with a warrant, testing it for bias, and making companies actually follow rules.</p>
    <p>Everyone sees this tech differently. Some see safety. Others see control. And that’s why it’s important we all talk about it before it gets out of hand!</p>

  <section id="conclusion" style="display:none">
    <h2>Conclusion + Recommendations</h2>
    <div class="banner">
      <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/577585/pexels-photo-577585.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" alt="Scales of justice with tech theme">
    </div>
    <p>Facial recognition is powerful, and it’s definitely not going away anytime soon. It helps with some things, like unlocking your phone or maybe even finding missing people. But at the same time, it can also hurt people if we don’t put clear rules in place!</p>
    <p>So here’s what we recommend:
      <ul>
        <li>Only use it in serious cases. Not just to catch shoplifters.</li>
        <li>Make it mandatory to get real consent or a warrant before scanning people.</li>
        <li>Test every system for bias and share the results publicly.</li>
        <li>Ban it completely in places like schools, hospitals, or protests.</li>
        <li>Give people the right to opt out and delete their data.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We believe technology should help people, not control them. It’s time to be smart and fair about how we use facial recognition. Because at the end of the day, this isn’t just about tech. It’s about trust, rights, and the kind of future we want to build!</p>
